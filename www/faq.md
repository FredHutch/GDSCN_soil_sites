## What should I look for in a sampling site?
* It needs to be big enough! We recommend a space 10 yards square (you can measure 10 yards by taking 10 big steps).
* Make sure the area is at least 3 feet away from a road to avoid vehicle contamination of the soil.
* If possible, try to pick a site that hasn't obviously been disturbed or changed recently, as the microbial community might not have reached a stable equilibrium yet. We recommend waiting at least **1 year** after construction or other major activities.
* Try to pick sites that you think would be interesting! For the pilot sampling, we focused on managed vs unmanaged sites and tried to sample a variety of landscapes. Managed sites are generally those that have been used as lawns, playing fields, or gardens; unmanaged sites include places like meadows and forests.
* You should pick 5 sites, with 2 replicates at each, for a total of ten samples.


## How do I get permission to sample at a location?
Land that you might want to sample will generally be one of three types: public land (like parks or playing fields), university and college grounds, or private land.
* For _public land_, the best approach is to email the appropriate contact person for permission. Public lands are generally managed by county, town, or city Park Services. Contact information can usually be found on the specific park websites. A template email is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6bPBZFO2DhANMJHlNXqAMSAMBqpYjXlHl9JMxNAx6k/edit)!

_Tip 1:_ Be specific about what sites you want to sample (they often will give a permit for just those sites).
_Tip 2:_ Be prepared to be passed to several people, as the request is unusual and they don't always immediately know who the proper staff member to deal with the request is.
_Tip 3:_ If they seem hesitant, assure them that you'll be taking very little soil and the grass cover will not be visually disturbed, since the samples will be taken from 5 inches below the ground.

* For _college and university grounds_, you should contact the Facilities department. We have found email works best. You can follow the same [template email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6bPBZFO2DhANMJHlNXqAMSAMBqpYjXlHl9JMxNAx6k/edit) and approach used for public land.

* For _private land_, you'll need to approach the owner. You may have to approach the owner in person or perhaps by phone. You can follow the same script as in the [template email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6bPBZFO2DhANMJHlNXqAMSAMBqpYjXlHl9JMxNAx6k/edit).

Please add a copy of the email or written permission in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g6zM45aHqtesIy3xc2QoZr_HPXa_NeKD?usp=share_link). If permission was given verbally, please add to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QAGvneJ8bbR3AHK6YUkv3xT3p3NeJ82K_5k3y7jswJI/edit?usp=sharing) with the details of who you spoke with and when.

## How do I collect samples?
We have prepared a protocol to make this easy! Check out the written protocol [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyFaknksSQEpwN7yGEBuGZaDGN96rKGOaovGsbhlGic/edit#heading=h.rlfcx57l2u2o). We have also created [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzgm426KgvrhheloBdlSWshM9v2VvJEcX) for you to reference.


## What information do I need to collect from students before we go into the field?
* Make sure you have all participating students sign a liability waiver. Your school may have a specific one they want you to use; check with administration or student services. 
* If you are taking pictures for the GDSCN archives, we ask that you also have students sign a photo release form giving us permission to use their image on the website or in future presentations.
* A standard liability waiver and photo release is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QattQqL5CadjMrIrRRz32zNZYbeT5p1sVr2l7RFQl9Y/edit)!


## How do I store the samples being sent for DNA analysis?
You should be able to store the soil samples at room temperature. The DNA/RNA Shield chemicals should keep the microbial DNA from degrading before the samples get analyzed in the lab. However, it doesn't hurt to keep them in a refrigerator! (Don't freeze them, but a standard refrigerator or a lab refrigerator at 4 C is fine.) 

Try to avoid leaving the samples in hot places or in the sunlight. The DNA/RNA Shield can only do so much to protect the DNA, but the heat can still cause degradation.


## How do I dry the samples being sent for elemental analysis?
The soil can be dried at room temperature. Simply spread it out on the aluminum baking sheet out of direct sunlight. There's no need to bake the soil or use an oven to speed the process up. The goal is to prevent/slow any excess mold or microbial growth caused by excess moisture.


## Do I have to pay for shipping the samples back to you?
Nope! All shipping costs will be paid for by the project. When you're ready to send your samples back, contact Natalie Kucher (nkucher3@jhu.edu) and she will send you a shipping label.


## How long will it take for my samples to be analyzed?
We expect the process to take several weeks, depending on when we receive the samples and how many we need to process at once.
