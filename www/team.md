# The Research Team

BioDIGS is run by the Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN). The GDSCN is a consortium of educators who are dedicated to expanding genomic data science and bioinformatics education to students at typically underresourced institutions including community colleges, HBCUs, tribal colleges and universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions. They are supported by Johns Hopkins University, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and the National Human Genome Research Institute. You can learn more about the GDSCN [here](https://www.gdscn.org/home).

## Who did the soil sampling?

Soil sampling for BioDIGS was done by both faculty and student volunteers from schools that aren't traditional R1 research institutions. Information about the schools and programs involved are on the map near each sampling area.

Many of the faculty are also members of the GDSCN.
