The following are materials designed to help you dive into BioDIGS. This could be for your own learning, or for you to implement in your classrooms!

## BioDIGS In the Classroom

Explore soil data and metadata from the BioDIGS Project! The activities in this guide are written for undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. Some sections require basic understanding of the R programming language, which is indicated at the beginning of each chapter.

Activities leverage NHGRI's [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/) cloud computing platform. AnVIL is the preferred computing platform for the [GDSCN](https://www.gdscn.org/home). However, all of the activities can be done using personal installations of R or using the online [Galaxy](usegalaxy.org) portal.
