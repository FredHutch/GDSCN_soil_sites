Zn_EPA3051,"Zinc (mg/kg), EPA Method 3051A"
water_pH,pH
OM_by_LOI_pct,Organic Matter by Loss on Ignition

Est_CEC,Cation Exchange Capacity (meq/100g) at pH 7.0 (CEC)
Base_Sat_pct,"Base saturation (BS). This represents the percentage of CEC occupied by bases (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+). The %BS increases with increasing soil pH. The availability of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ increases with increasing %BS."
P_Sat_ratio,Phosphorus saturation ratio. This is the ratio between the amount of phosphorus present in the soil and the total capacity of that soil to retain phosphorus. The ability of phosphorus to be bound in the soil is primary a function of iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) content in that soil.
